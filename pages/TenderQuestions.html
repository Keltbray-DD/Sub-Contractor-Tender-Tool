          Failure of personnel to attend sites when required (“no shows”) can result in the need to cancel the

          result in significant wasted costs and disruption (e.g. cancellation costs relating to staff, equipment
          and plant already ordered or delivered to the site due to inability to proceed with the planned
          works, re-scheduling access and re-arranging the work and the required inputs for another date).
